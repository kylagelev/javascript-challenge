## Welcome to the search for extraterrestrial life. 

In this repository, data from the [UFO Sightings Data](https://github.com/kylagelev/javascript-challenge/blob/main/UFO-level-1/static/js/data.js) dataset found in UFO-level-1 and UFO-level-2 in each respective static/js folder, will be able to be accessed in the static/js folder as well under the name app.js.

## UFO-level-1

At this level, a user is able to input a datetime and search the data for their desired results. The app also includes a clear button to remove data from the table, along with letting the user know if their search has no results. Both are useful to ensure that data is accurate to what is being searched for and letting the user know what datetimes are associated to specific sightings in the dataset and which do not have data associated.

## UFO-level-2

At this level, a user is able to input a datetime, city, state, country, and/or shape to search the data to find their desired results. The app, similarly to UFO-level-1, also includes a clear button to remove data from the table, along with letting the user know if their search has no results. Both are useful to ensure that data is accurate to what is being searched for and letting the user know whether their search contains results.
